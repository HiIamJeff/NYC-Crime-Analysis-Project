# NYC-Crime-Analysis-Project


Welcome to NYC Crime Analysis Project!In this project, I took NYPD Complaint Data to do some exploratary analysis and evetually answer the questions with statistics: Do the different boroughs have significant differences in terms of crime level and crime type? 

I used Python and Tableau to do the data preprocessing, analysis and visualization. And the dataset I worked on could be found at the following website : https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243

p.s. If you are interested in the more concise version of the project, please visit my medium article ().

Please let me know if something isn't clear or you have some thought on this project.
