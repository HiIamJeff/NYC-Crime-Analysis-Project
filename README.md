# NYC-Crime-Analysis-Project


Welcome to NYC Crime Analysis Project!In this project, I took NYPD Complaint Data to do some exploratary analysis and evetually answer the questions with statistics: Do the different boroughs have significant differences in terms of crime level and crime type?

I used Python and Tableau to do the data preprocessing, analysis and visualization. And the dataset I worked on could be found at the following [website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) (Please be aware that the dataset is about 1.9GB)


Please let me know if something isn't clear or you have some thought on this project.
