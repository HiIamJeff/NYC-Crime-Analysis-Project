# NYC-Crime-Analysis-Project


Welcome to NYC Crime Analysis Project!In this project, I took NYPD Complaint Data to do some exploratary analysis and evetually answer the questions with statistics: Do the different boroughs have significant differences in terms of crime level and crime type? 

p.s. If you are interested in the more concise version of the project, please visit my medium article ().


I used Python and Tableau to do the data preprocessing, analysis and visualization. And the dataset I worked on could be found at the following website (Please be aware that the dataset is about 1.9GB) : https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i


Please let me know if something isn't clear or you have some thought on this project.
