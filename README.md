# NYC-Crime-Analysis-Project


Welcome to NYC Crime Analysis Project. In this project, I used NYPD Complaint Data to do some exploratary analysis and evetually answer this questions: Do the different boroughs have significant differences in terms of crime level and crime type?

I used Python and Tableau to do the analysis and visualization. And the dataset I used could be found at this website: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243

Please let me know if something isn't clear or you have some thought on this project.
